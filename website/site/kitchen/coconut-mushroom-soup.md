* Servings: 4
* Preparation time: 5-10 minutes
* Cooking time: 16-18 minutes
* Vegan

## Ingredients

* 250g Button mushrooms
* 250g Oyster mushrooms
* 4 Large shitake mushrooms
* 1-2 tbsp Virgin coconut oil
* 500ml Coconut milk
* 2 tbsp Coconut cream
* 2 Large cloves garlic
* 1 Handful fresh dill
* 2 Small bunches of chives or spring onions
* 2 Cardamom pods (optional)
* Sea salt

## Preparation

Wash all the mushrooms, chives and dill. Chop and mash the garlic, set aside.

Remove the larger stems from the dill and chop finely.

Trim and chop all the mushrooms into 1 inch slices, keep different mushrooms separated.

Chop the chives into slices about 1-2cm in length.

## Cooking

Add the button mushrooms to a medium sized saucepan on a medium heat along with the coconut oil.

When the juice has left the mushrooms reduce to about half the amount of liquid.

Add the oyster mushrooms, mashed garlic, dill and half of the chopped chives; season with about 3-4 pinches of salt.

Cook for about 3-4 minutes or until nearly completely reduced.

Add the coconut milk, coconut cream and cardamom pods. Stir the coconut cream into the mixture, it should be creamy but not too thick.

Simmer for 3-4 minutes and then add the shitake mushrooms and the rest of the chives but save some chives for the garnish.

Cook on a medium simmer with the shitake mushrooms for 8-10 minutes stirring fairly frequently.

After about 8 minutes taste the shitake mushrooms to check they have the right bite. Cook for a few minutes longer if necessary.

Serve immediately and garnish with the remaining chives.

## Serving Suggestions

Serve with a few slices of wholegrain bread or on a bed of brown or red rice.

For a less rich dish add warm coconut milk on top of the soup when serving.

## Notes

* Adjust the amount of coconut milk to change the consistency.
* Use a little more salt perhaps.
* Dash of lime would be interesting.
* Experiment with more cardamom flavour.
