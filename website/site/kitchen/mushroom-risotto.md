Delicious vegetarian creamy mushroom risotto.

* Servings: 4
* Preparation time: 10 minutes
* Cooking time: 45 minutes

## Ingredients

* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 3 cups shitake, oyster and button mushrooms
* 1 cup dry white wine
* 5-6 cups vegetable stock
* 1/3 cup peeled and minced shallots
* 2 cups arborio rice or other risotto rice
* 1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 tbsp fleshly chopped chives

## Cooking

Bring stock to a simmer in a saucepan.

Heat the olive oil in a deep, heavy, medium sized saucepan over medium-high heat.

Add mushrooms and shallots and sauté about 5 minutes (if using chanterelles,
dry sauté first for a minute or two and let the mushrooms cook in their own
juices before adding the butter).

Add the rice and stir to combine.

Add white wine, bring to a boil, and reduce liquid by half, about 3-4 minutes.

Add simmering stock, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring enough to keep the rice from
sticking to the edges of the pan. Stir the rice almost constantly — stirring sloughs
off the starch from the rice, making the creamy sauce you're looking for in
a risotto. Wait until the stock is almost completely absorbed before adding the
next 1/2 cup. This process will take about 25 minutes.

The rice should be just cooked and slightly chewy.

Stir in the parmesan cheese and season to taste with salt and pepper.

Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or chives.
