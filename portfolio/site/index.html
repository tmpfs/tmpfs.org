    <h3>Digital Craftsman</h3>
    <p>Since pioneering the digital nomad lifestyle and then settling in a tropical paradise I aim for the perfect work/life balance that harmonizes creative and healthy activities with creating beautiful software.</p>

    <p>Qualified as a sound engineer, divemaster and skydiver I tend nowadays to spend my time studying permaculture in the garden or creating magic in the kitchen. I can often be found practicing shakuhachi, yoga, serving the finest grade teas or at the beach for sun and freediving.</p>

    <p>A lifelong autodidact I enjoy traveling, exploring, kayaking, literature, philosophy, theology, etymology, nature, permaculture and many other activities.</p>
