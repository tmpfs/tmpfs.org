* Preparation time: 5 minutes
* Cooking time: 10 minutes

## Ingredients

* 50g raw organic cacao paste
* 1 pinch of high grade sea salt
* 1 tsp virgin cold-pressed coconut oil
* 2 tsp high quality honey
* 1 vanilla pod
* 1 cardamom pod
* 1 clove
* 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon powder

## Preparation

Slice the vanilla pod down the middle and scrape the vanilla from the pod using a teaspoon, be sure to remove all the vanilla to get the full flavour. Remove the skin from the cardamom pod and grind the contents to a powder using a mortar and pestle. Grind the clove to a fine powder in the mortar and pestle, you may wish to pinch the ground clove between the fingers to help break it apart into a finer powder.

Mix the cardamom, vanilla, clove and cinnamon together into a spice mixture.

## Cooking

Melt the cacao paste slowly on a low to medium heat in a double boiler.

Add the pinch of salt, coconut oil, honey and spice mixture.

Stir whilst melting until the consistency is smooth and creamy.

Remove from the heat and pour into a container to set in the freezer for 1-2 hours.
