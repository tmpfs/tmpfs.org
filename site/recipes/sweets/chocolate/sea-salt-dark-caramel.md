Dark caramel chocolate with a sea salt bite.

* Servings: 2 - 4
* Preparation time: 5 minutes
* Cooking time: 10 minutes

## Ingredients

* 50g raw organic cacao paste
* 1/8 teaspoon of high grade granular sea salt
* 1 tsp virgin cold-pressed coconut oil
* 2 tsp dark caramel

## Preparation

Cook a dark caramel.

Choose a very high quality sea salt that has medium sized granules so the chocolate has a salty bite. If the granules are too large reduce the size by gently grinding in a mortar and pestle.

## Cooking

Melt the cacao paste slowly on a low to medium heat in a double boiler.

Add the salt, coconut oil and caramel.

Stir whilst melting until the consistency is smooth and creamy.

Remove from the heat and pour into a container to set in the freezer for 1-2 hours.
