## Ingredients

* 1 cup masoor dal (small orange, a.k.a. "red" lentils)
* 3 cups water
* 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 2 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil
* 1/2 teaspoon brown mustard seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 large garlic clove

## Cooking

Bring lentils and three cups of water to a boil with turmeric in a heavy saucepan.

When the lentils are cooked, heat the ghee (or oil) in a small frying pan over medium-high heat
until it shimmers. Then cook the shallots, garlic, mustard seeds, cumin seeds and chilli
until mustard seeds begin to pop and/or turn gray and cumin seeds brown.

Stir spice mixture into lentils with coconut milk, cilantro, lemon juice, and
salt and bring to a simmer.
