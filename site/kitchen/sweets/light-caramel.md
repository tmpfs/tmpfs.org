Silky smooth classic caramel.

* Servings: 8-12
* Preparation time: 2 minutes
* Cooking time: 20 minutes

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup white granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup water
* 1/2 cup thick cooking cream

## Preparation

Measure the cooking cream so that is is ready when the water and sugar solution has caramelized.

## Cooking

Sprinkle the sugar evenly over the bottom of a heavy medium steel pan. The pan should be a light metal finish so that it is easier to see the amber colour that appears as the caramelization process happens.

Cover the sugar with the water and ensure that the solution is evenly spread.

Heat on a low to medium heat. After about 5 minutes all the sugar should have dissolved. When 10 minutes is reached the bubbles will appear quite foamy and at about 15 minutes the bubbles take on a honeycomb shape and you may start to see the amber colour of the caramelization. Pay close attention so the mixture does not burn, you should see an amber brown colour to the mixture.

When the honeycomb bubbles are a nice amber brown and start to foam and rise remove from the heat and add the cream stirring continuously until smooth and creamy, if lumps form place back on the stove on a very low heat and gently warm the mixture whilst stirring.

Once the caramel has a smooth creamy consistency pour into a jar for storage.
