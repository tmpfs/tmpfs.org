Hi,

My friends call me Muji; I am a programmer, software architect and digital craftsman.

Since pioneering the digital nomad lifestyle and then settling in a tropical paradise I aim for a good work/life balance that harmonizes creative and healthy activities with creating beautiful software.

Qualified as a sound engineer, divemaster and skydiver I tend nowadays to spend my time studying permaculture in the garden or creating magic in the kitchen. I can often be found practicing shakuhachi, yoga, serving the finest grade teas or at the beach for sun and freediving.

A lifelong autodidact I enjoy traveling, exploring, kayaking, literature, philosophy, theology, etymology, nature, permaculture and many other activities.

Every once in a while I will add a recipe to the [[kitchen]] or post an article to the [[blog]].
