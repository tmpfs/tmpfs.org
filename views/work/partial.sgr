  p Created a microservices platform for delivering realtime websocket applications including all client and server code. Work was done remotely from Indonesia for an Australian startup in the realtime content space, the platform was written from scratch to support up to 10,000 concurrent users and tools were developed to enable third-party developers to rapidly create rich realtime applications.

  p(mdi) Much of the platform remains private but during the course of the project various components were released as open-source; you can view the source code at the [socially github profile](https://github.com/socialally).

  h3 Open Source
  p(mdi) As a believer in the benefits of open-source development I have contributed to many open-source projects including [commonmark](http://commonmark.org/), [source highlight](https://www.gnu.org/software/src-highlite/source-highlight.html) and [help2man](https://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/). Recently the focus of my own open-source projects has been on [mkdoc](https://github.com/mkdoc/mkdoc) and [trucks](https://github.com/tmpfs/trucks); for more open-source projects see my [github profile](https://github.com/tmpfs).

  p(mdi) Whilst working with [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org) I have contributed over 200 packages to the [npm registry](https://npmjs.com), you can view [all the packages](https://npmjs.com/~/muji).

  p Fast, versatile and modular toolkit for processing markdown documents as streams featuring a suite of command line interfaces and a programmatic API that includes bindings to many modules for common tasks.
  p(mdi) Use the toolkit to generate dynamic readme documents, simple static web pages or generate API documentation. The [mkcli](https://github.com/mkdoc/mkcli) module is a particularly useful tool for defining command line interfaces as markdown and generating language-agnostic program definitions, help documents, man pages and zsh completion scripts.
