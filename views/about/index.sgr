    h2 About
    p Since creating my first web page in 1998 I have been studying programming and working in the digital industry.
    p Over the course of my career I have created many simple and complex web applications, desktop applications, e-commerce websites, implemented over the wire protocols, designed binary file formats and many esoteric projects including satellite phone SMS microblogging with GPS co-ordinate mapping.

    p I believe very strongly in using the right tool for the job and carefully evaluate the most appropriate technology stack for each project.

    h3 Workflow
    p I evangelize a document, test, code and iterate workflow to create robust and maintainable software.
